2. 'reinforcement_learning'
3. 'gradient_approximation'
4. 'optimization_algorithm'

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `src/`: Source code for data loading, model architecture, training, and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `results/`: Contains results.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `LICENSE`: License for the code.
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore file.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Steps to Follow
1. Data Preparation: Place raw data files in the data/raw/ directory and run the data processing scripts.
2. Model Training: Run src/train.py to train the model.
3. Model Evaluation: Run src/evaluate.py to evaluate the model performance.
